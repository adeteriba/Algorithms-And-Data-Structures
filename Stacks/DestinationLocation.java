Problem Statement
In this task you will get a set of instructions to get from a home location to a destination location. 
You have to give the instructions which begin at the destination location and return to the home location. 
In other words, you need to reverse the directions. Sometimes a mistake will be make with the directions, meaning that the latest direction should be deleted. The possible set of directions is "Go North", "Go South", "Go East" and "Go West". Another possible instruction is "Go Back" which means to undo the latest step. 
The instruction "Arrived" means the sequence of directions is complete.
The way to solve this problem is to push all the instructions onto the stack, pop when you get "Go Back", and then pop them all off at the end (flipping North <-> South and East <-> West) to have a reversed set of instructions to get you home. 
You can copy and paste the code for a Stack class from the notes and alter it to work with Strings (or maybe use chars or ints if you want to represent the instructions in a different format).

NOTE: You will never be asked to "Go Back" without at least 1 previous valid direction

Input Format
A sequence of n lines which can consist of "Go North", "Go South", "Go East", "Go West", "Go Back" and "Arrived" 

Output Format
A reversed set of instructions, each instruction on a separate line, which can consist of "Go North", "Go South", "Go East", and "Go West"

Constraints
1≤n≤100

Sample Input
Go North
Go North
Go West
Go Back
Arrived

Sample Output
Go South
Go South
