# Fibonnaci Sequence

Fibonnaci sequence is defined Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with seed values 0 and 1 for the first two terms, 

giving rise to the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... where every term is the sum of the two terms before it. 

Let's invent a "Tribonnaci" sequence where Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) + F(n-3) and the first three terms are F(0)=0, F(1)=0 and F(2)=1. 

Given an input number n, find the nth term of the "Tribonnaci" sequence.
